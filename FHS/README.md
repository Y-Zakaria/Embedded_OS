# Embedded_OS FHS


In this project I have created a simple code to explore File Hierarchy Standard supported by Linux, specially the internal information of Linux kernel provided by  /proc files system.

- The first program gives details about the configuration of the machine where the execution is done.
- The second code explore processes and thread in Linux
