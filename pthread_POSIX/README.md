# Embedded_OS Posix_Threads


This project aims to manipulate the pthread library which is an implementation of the POSIX standard on Unix operating systems. It also deals with the exploitation of inter-process communication mechanisms (IPC, Inter Process Communication): semaphores (mutex), conditional variables, message queues and asynchronous I/Os.
